## Fixed Issue

- A fail score is not update when note is pass a goal. ([#3](https://github.com/HelloYeew/taiko-rust/issues/3))
  Fix in [#5](https://github.com/HelloYeew/taiko-rust/pull/5)

## New Progress

### Adjust note spawn position further

At first it spawned in screen, not it spawned from out of screen.

Commit :

- [Adjust spawn position to make note spawn out of screen](https://github.com/HelloYeew/taiko-rust/pull/5/commits/fe8e87c5bb2730f23a89e8b7261688e2cc45ba8e)

### Add more UI on lane (with make note despawn look better)

Add a new lanes UI to make a lanes as a new layer and make a note despawn under a new lanes layer. (This is just a new design prototype. Will adjust this in future)

- [Add new lane layer](https://github.com/HelloYeew/taiko-rust/pull/5/commits/1c71769abc7df5b069d129dcfa651145c1685ea1) : To make a note that miss get destroy behind this layer
- [Adjust note lane to just one resource](https://github.com/HelloYeew/taiko-rust/pull/5/commits/0f3b384b29e2ed1751b39ae6ba4a06b8616de4a8) : Trying to make it first by using only one layer but I try it and I think two layer is better. (Think on theme customization, two layer make a theme more various and more style.)
